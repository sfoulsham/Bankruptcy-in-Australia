# Bankruptcy-in-Australia
 This repository contains an Anaconda project analysing bankruptcy in Australia within the past eleven years. It answers questions like which state has the greatest average weekly pay and the greatest average population, does population or income have a direct relationship with bankruptcy, and is any state disproportionately affected?
